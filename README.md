  Our project is about an online food ordering & Donating system . It overcomes the disadvantages of the traditional queueing system. It is a medium to order online food  hassle free from restaurants as well as mess service and donate food from home. Our mission is to end hunger and no wasting of food to make a hungry-free world. According to the latest survey, 1.3 billion tons of food is thrown as waste every year.  Additionally, one-third of the food consumed is stated as leftovers.  The focus of this project is to reduce the amount of food wasted and being used to the needy people.
